                            MARCS is an information hub for protein interactions with chromatin states based
                            on 55 di-nucleosome SILAC Affinity Purification (SNAP) experiments.
                            MARCS compiles bespoke analysis and visualisation tools of the data,
                            which are designed for interactivity and usability.
